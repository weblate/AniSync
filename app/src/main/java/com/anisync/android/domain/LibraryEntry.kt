/**
 * The three levels AniList's `MediaList.priority` is shown as.
 *
 * The API documents the field only as "Priority of planning (Min: 0, Max: 255)" — no enum, no
 * named levels, and anilist.co never renders it. 255 is the storage ceiling, not a scale, so the
 * meaning belongs to the client: 0/1/2 matches AniHyou, which is the only other client that writes
 * the field, and interop is the whole reason to agree on numbers at all.
 *
 * Reading is deliberately wider than writing. [of] folds anything at or above 2 into [HIGH] so a
 * value set elsewhere still renders, and a save only sends `priority` when the control was
 * actually touched, so a foreign 3..255 survives a round trip through this app.
