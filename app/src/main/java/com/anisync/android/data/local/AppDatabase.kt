/**
 * Room database for offline caching.
 *
 * Version History:
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * v28 (Sep 2026):
 *   - Added field to library_entries:
 *     • priority - raw AniList MediaList.priority, shown as Low/Medium/High and
 *       sortable. Defaults to 0, which is both "Low" and "never set" on the wire,
 *       so existing rows read correctly without a backfill. Auto-migration.
 *
 * v25 (Aug 2026):
 *   - Added fields to library_entries:
 *     • progressVolumes - volumes read, manga only, null until one is recorded
 *     • advancedScores - per-category scores as a JSON object keyed by the
 *       viewer's advanced scoring category names, '{}' when the feature is off
 *     Auto-migration, both columns default so existing rows are untouched.
 *
 * v24 (Aug 2026):
 *   - Added media_themes table for the AnimeThemes openings and endings lookup:
 *     • mediaId, themes (JSON blob), fetchedAt
 *     An empty themes list is stored deliberately, recording that AnimeThemes does
 *     not list the title so the page stops asking. Auto-migration, new table only.
 *
 * v23 (Aug 2026):
 *   - airing_schedule is now account scoped:
 *     • ownerId joined the primary key, matching library_entries since v18, so a
 *       switch no longer has to wipe the table and isWatching stops meaning
 *       whichever account was last active. Manual migration. Existing rows are
 *       carried over under ownerId -1 and claimed by the signed-in account in
 *       AccountManager.reconcileActiveAccount, so upgrading users do not stare at
 *       empty widgets while a network refresh runs.
 *
 * v19 (Jun 2026):
 *   - Added field to user_profile:
 *     • aboutMarkdown - raw markdown bio (about asHtml:false), cached next to the
 *       rendered HTML so the bio editor loads clean source instead of falling back
 *       to the asHtml-wrapped HTML (which saved corrupted markup back to AniList).
 *
 * v18 (Jun 2026):
 *   - Added field to library_entries:
 *     • ownerId - AniList user id the entry belongs to, so multiple accounts'
 *       libraries persist side by side (instant switch from cache, no bleed).
 *       Existing rows default to 0 and are re-tagged to the real id on first
 *       account reconcile.
 *
 * v17 (Jun 2026):
 *   - Added fields to media_details:
 *     • isRecommendationBlocked - hides the "add recommendation" action when true
 *     • isReviewBlocked - hides the "write review" action when true
 *
 * v16 (May 2026):
 *   - Added field to media_details:
 *     • coverColor - average cover hex color, used to tint rich-text link cards
 *       (previously only fetched on the network path, so cached media link cards
 *        rendered with no accent tint)
 *
 * v15 (May 2026):
 *   - Added fields to media_details:
 *     • popularity, favourites - AniList community stats
 *     • nextAiringTimeUntil - seconds-snapshot fallback for next episode airing
 *     • staff - lightweight staff list for media details page
 *
 * v4 (Mar 2026):
 *   - Added saved_forum_threads table for local thread bookmarks
 *     • threadId, title, authorName, authorAvatarUrl
 *     • replyCount, viewCount, likeCount
 *     • isLiked, isLocked
 *     • repliedAt, replyUserName, replyUserAvatarUrl
 *     • categories, mediaTitle, mediaCoverUrl, savedAt
 *
 * v3 (Feb 2026):
 *   - Added fields to media_details:
 *     • source - Source material (Manga, Light Novel, Original, etc.)
 *     • Tag description field for tooltip support
 *
 * v2 (Feb 2026):
 *   - Added fields to media_details:
 *     • endDate - Formatted end date string
 *     • duration - Episode duration in minutes
 *     • tags - List of content tags (themes, warnings)
 *     • trailer - Trailer info (id, site, thumbnail)
 *
 * v1 (Fresh Start - June 2025):
 *   - Initial production schema (reset from development iterations)
 *   - Tables:
 *     • library_entries - User's anime/manga library with 9 indices for sorting/filtering
 *     • media_details - Cached media details with characters, relations, external links
 *     • user_profile - User profile with stats, favorites, and activity
 *     • airing_schedule - Airing schedule items with watching status
 *     • trending_media - Trending media for home screen
 *   - TypeConverters: JSON-based serialization for complex types (Converters.kt)
 *
 * Migration Guidelines:
 *   - Auto-migrations: Use for simple changes (add columns, tables, indices)
 *   - Manual migrations: Use for complex changes (see Migrations.kt)
 *   - Always test migrations before release (see MigrationTest.kt)
